<p style="width:300px;height:400px;word-wrap:break-word;">"A gazelle is one of many antelope species in the genus Gazella. Gazelles are known as swift animals. Some can run at bursts as high as 100 km/h (60 mph) or run at a sustained speed of 50 km/h (30 mph). Gazelles are found mostly in the deserts, grasslands, and savannas of Africa, but they are also found in southwest and central Asia and the Indian subcontinent. They tend to live in herds, and eat fine, easily digestible plants and leaves." <br><br><strong>This description was taken from the following article:</strong><br>Wikipedia The Free Encyclopedia.
