<p style="width:300px;height:400px;word-wrap:break-word;">"The meerkat (Suricata suricatta) or suricate is a small mongoose found in southern Africa. It is characterised by a broad head, large eyes, a pointed snout, long legs, a thin tapering tail, and a brindled coat pattern. Meerkats are highly social, and form packs of two to 30 individuals each that occupy home ranges around 5 km2 (1.9 sq mi) in area. They live in rock crevices in stony, often calcareous areas, and in large burrow systems in plains. Commonly living in arid, open habitats with little woody vegetation, meerkats occur in southwestern Botswana, western and southern Namibia, and northern and western South Africa; the range barely extends into southwestern Angola." <br><br><strong>This description was taken from the following article:</strong><br>Wikipedia The Free Encyclopedia.
